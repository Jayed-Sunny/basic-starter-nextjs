## This project is organized into several folders for better organization and easy navigation.


# Core Folders (3)
.next: Created during project setup, this folder holds various information like cache, server settings, static assets, and types.
app: Aligned with the latest router system, this folder houses all page files, each corresponding to its designated route based on the file hierarchy.
